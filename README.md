# SDV_DwarvenExpansionVisitMountVapiusPatch
A patch to integrate Dwarven Expansion with Visit Mount Vapius.

Adds new Dwarven Jewelry Maker recipes for the new gems and minerals in Visit Mount Vapius.

The new gems produce brooches from the machine:
- Demantoide Brooch
- Carnelian Brooch
- Turquoise Brooch
- Garnet Brooch
- Morganite Brooch
- Heliodor Brooch
- Labradorite Brooch
- Sweet Gem Berry Brooch
- Void Diamond Brooch
- Tourmaline Brooch
- Larimar Brooch
- Blue Agathe Brooch

The value of the new brooches is based on the value of the input gem.  The quality is based on the quality of the input gem unless the input gem is Polished in the Gem Polisher from Visit Mount Vapius.

Polished versions of each stone (vanilla and new) automatically produce an iridium quality version of the jewelry regardless of the input quality.

This patch renames the Dwarven Gem Polisher from my mod to the "Dwarven Gem Cutter" to hopefully avoid confusion with the "Gem Polisher" from Visit Mount Vapius.

Adds new custom textures when the mushroom box from Dwarven Expansion is growing mushrooms from Visit Mount Vapius.
